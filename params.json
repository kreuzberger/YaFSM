Details on the xml tags are given in Apppendix xx. You can edit the file with any text editor you like.\r\nTo verify the xml file you can test it agains the given xsd schema file ,that can be found in the xml directory.\r\n\r\nOn Linux you could use xmllint, on windows e.g. xmlstarlet\r\n\r\nxmllint -s yafsm.xsd <yourfsm.xml>\r\n\r\nOn Linux you could use xmllint, on windows e.g. xmlstarlet\r\n\r\nUsage of the generator\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAn example for use of the generator is given in src/perl/CmakeLists.txt\r\n\r\n    perl -f YaFsm.pl --fsm=<xml-file> --genview --gencode\r\n\r\nThis will generate the source code and viewer input files into subdirectories of the current directoy.\r\n\r\nYou can also give the name of the output directory via cmd line. To list all available options just call\r\n\r\n    perl -f YaFsm.pl --help\r\n\r\nCompilation\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe fsm code generator has not to be build into an executable, cause it is a perl script. So its ready to use on linux and windows. On Windows you should use ActivePerl. On Linux you have to install the xmlsimple perl package from your distribution or also use ActivePerl.\r\n\r\nThe YaFsmViewer can be compiled using the provided cmake scripts. Be aware that for unit tests the unittest++ framework is used and for the YaFsmViewer QT >= 4.5.2 is required.\r\n\r\nThe generated source code will not compile if used out of the example build tree, cause some include and source code files are missing. These files must be copied „by hand“ or by our build environment to the generated source code or e.g linked by a library. This has the advantage that you could use our own implementation and framework for the timer and event handling. Provided is an implementation for Qt4 (full featured) and a standard C++ implementation (no timers and events could be used in the fsm)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe YaFsmViewer\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe  files for the YaFsmViewer are generated into a seperated directory. This directory contains several files for each state hierarchy level\r\n\r\n* <state>.dot: Generated dot file for the state, use to generate html maps and image files with Graphviz dot\r\n* <state>.html: Html file with a map definition to display in the viewers QWebKit View\r\n* <state>.<GeneratedImageType>: Generated image file used by the map, default are SVG image files have full zooming capability in the viewer\r\n\r\nTo view the files in the viewer, just open the generated file „index.txt“ in the viewer or start the viewer with the file path from commandline.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw2.github.com/kreuzberger/YaFSM/master/doc/yafsmviewer/YaFsmViewer_TrafficLightStateRun.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
